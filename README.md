# Music-Database
This application was created with a command line interface. The database schema and  
programming objects are built with MySQL, and using Java version 12.0.1 as host language. The  
external library includes MySQL connector and the version I used was 8.0.23. The installation  
requirements for this application are just Java and MySQL connector.  
To run this application, either import the project to IDE and set library files for it, or run the jar  
file with path \DBfinalproject\out\artifacts\DBfinalproject_jar.  
After running this application, it will ask users to login and display a menu for users. A user has  
access to all the information of songs and can like, dislike, comment each song.
